# EvenParVIE

This is a tiny little Telegram bot that uses the parsed event data from this repo to show the latest
events for the current weekend. The idea is to create an handy bot that is easy to use and can be
used to show the current events and provide the functionality to filter the clubs and distribute
additional events (TBD).

The bot can be accessed on Telegram via the following link: https://t.me/evenparbot

## Help (copied from the bot help message)

```
How to use the bot?
The following list shows the currently available commands with a short description.

- To get the events list run /events and choose the day you want to check.
- To toggle the reminder or change its time, use /reminder.
- To get a list of currently available clubs, use the command /list.
- To display this help message again, you can run /help.
- To report any feedback/issue/request, use /report.
- To cancel any reminder/report interaction, use /cancel at any time.

What's more to come?
Here is a list of features I have in mind that will be implemented sooner or later.

- Add a custom event to distribute it to others.
- Prefilter the clubs you wish to get updates about.
- Get updates about the next week.
- Private channel to talk to others or exchange further event information.

Feedback/Issues/Requests?
If you got any of the above you can use one of the following methods:

- Use the bot builtin functionality. (/report)
- Open up an Issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/mitschix/evenpargo/issues). (if you know what that is and how to use it :D)
- Access the [Customer Support channel](https://t.me/+bzJJYZaQ7ddlYzI0) and get updates or chat.
- Contact me directly and tell me what's on your mind. (:
