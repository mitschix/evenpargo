WELCOME_MSG = """Welcome to *EvenParVIE*! (:

This is a tiny little bot that tries to visit the websites of a bunch of _clubs in Vienna_ to get the latest events for the current weekend. This can be useful to get a quick overview and see where you want to go out.

To get the events - run /events and choose the day you wish to get information about.
To get the list of available clubs - run /list
To get more information or if you need any help - run /help.

Feedback is very much appreciated. (:

Have a nice day/night and KEEP RAVING. üòÅ

The following list shows the currently available commands with a short description.
