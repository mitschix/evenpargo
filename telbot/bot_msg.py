WELCOME_MSG = """Welcome to *EvenParVIE*! (:

This is a tiny little bot that tries to visit the websites of a bunch of _clubs in Vienna_ to get the latest events for the current weekend. This can be useful to get a quick overview and see where you want to go.

To get the events - run /events and choose the day you wish to get information about.
To get the list of available clubs - run /list.
To get more information or if you need any help - run /help.

Furthermore, the bot has a little reminder, which will send you one message with all days at a given time. It can be controlled with /reminder and is activated and set to _Thursday, 18:00_\\* at startup.

Feedback is very much appreciated. (:

Have a nice day/night and KEEP RAVING. üòÅ

\\* or 19:00 if daylight saving time is messing around. üò¨"""

HELP_MSG = """*How to use the bot?*
The following list shows the currently available commands with a short description.

- To get the events list run /events and choose the day you want to check.
- To toggle the reminder or change its time, use /reminder.
- To get a list of currently available clubs, use the command /list.
- To display this help message again, you can run /help.
- To report any feedback/issue/request, use /report.

*What's more to come?*
Here is a list of features I have in mind that will be implemented sooner or later.

- Add a custom event to distribute it to others.
- Prefilter the clubs you wish to get updates about.
- Get updates about the next week.
- Persistent reminder settings.
- Private channel to talk to others or exchange further event information.

*Feedback/Issues/Requests?*
If you got any of the above you can use one of the following methods:

- Use the bot builtin functionality. (/report)
- Open up an Issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/mitschix/evenpargo/issues). (if you know what that is and how to use it :D)
- Access the [customer support channel](https://t.me/+bzJJYZaQ7ddlYzI0) and chat.
- Contact me directly and tell me what's on your mind. (:
